"If you search on Google for the current inflation rate in the United States and then search on the internet for the current inflation rate in Iran, subtract the two rates from each other, divide by 100, and multiply it by the current exchange rate of the dollar to the Iranian rial. This pattern is something I continuously use and thought of delivering it to my friends in a graphical user interface format. 


Methodology:
The calculation method is as follows: This is done by first obtaining the inflation rate in the USA by searching for "usa inflation" on Google, which has been 3.6% so far. Then, search for the current inflation rate in Iran on Google using "iran inflation" and enter the value in the relevant fields. Finally, the current exchange rate of the US dollar in Iran will be presented to you.
Good luck!"
